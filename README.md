### Lab done!

Try to navigate normally from the windows 10.
Report us problems, issues and recomentaditions plus request for features.
Investigate and play while we continue developing it.
New version of the instalaltion-configuration scripts,ISOs and OVA virtual machine export will be upcoming.


## What the setup.sh app-installation-script.sh , app-configuration-script.sh , service.sh and wizard.sh do?

The setup.sh app-installation-script.sh , app-configuration-script.sh , service.sh will be esclusevilly for mounters or assemblers person who mount proffesionall or assemble profesional our products not for the end user. 

setup.sh app-installation-script.sh , app-configuration-script.sh , service.sh requires of plug of physical internet ethernet cable connection.

The end user will be using a USB with auto-installable un-attended ISO image.

Wizard.sh is for the end user and will be maturing and its the first thing the ISO image will be launching.

### 2 future version of the ISO:

- Online: For more profesionals. All is downloaded and compiled.

- Offline Live debian: For non profesional and guided installation.


## Installation workflow:

a) Call setup.sh.

Setup download other scripts and prepare environment. Also reports errors in installacion via centralized repository.(in way to make descentralized).

a.1) Prepare environment
a.2) Replace kernel with libre kernel.
a.3) change sources to not allow non free.

c) App-installation-scrip.sh

App-installation script install all necesary packages. Via different ways: apts,compiling,preparing.
c.1) Tools for filtering
c.2) Server services
c.3) Drivers for open source Wlan devices.

![initial-install-workflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13025157/14444383/5b99d710-0045-11e6-9ae8-3efa1645f355.png)

d) App-configuration-scrip.sh

App-configuration-script is the real CocaCola maker and in the future will be a encrypted blob, the result will remain be 100% opensource but the way to prepare will be secret. A hacker can duplicate and copy the whole rootfs and distribute it freely. 

e) wizard.sh

Wizard is the initial graphical user interface intendt that we created and will be replaced by a real GUI running in X limited browser.

f) services.sh

It shows up the addresses of your services from clearnet and darknets plus some important data and users.

g) Own development and integration of the opensource.

This already happened and will be increase as investors coming. The only inverstor is a single guy who invested 250k with 300 buyers from Crowdfunding that already losed their faith and patient. (invested 70k netto)


## Networking in Librerouter:

There are two bridges with two interfaces each in the machine like two bridges (only 2 separated zone NICs):
	
1. External area red bridge acting as WAN (2 nics): cable or wireless interface as DHCP client of your internet router.
2. Internal area gren bridge acting as LAN (2 nics): cable or wireless interface as an AP for being DHCP server for your new secure LAN.

## Four possible PHySICAL scenarios:

 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is WiFi, LAN is Cabled Ethernet
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is WiFi
 - WAN is Cabled Ethernet, LAN is Cabled Ethernet

## DNS:

- Unbound-dns is the DNS SERVER hsts domain list goes to dns hsts bypass engine. 
- If it is not resolved then using cached then we use DNSCRYPT to ask D.I.A.N.A and OpenNIC.
- If it can not resolved, then we need to ask through TOR aleatory.
- Further integration will include Bitname,others like DjDNS (this last need maintenance is not workinghttps://github.com/DJDNS/djdns)).

## Can the user in the future workaround the redirection in router mode:

Yes in the future via GUI should be possible to reconfigure this cage enabling services as plugins.



## Suricata Intrusion Prevention System Ruleset versus use cases configuration.

When user is using HTTPS connection to a darknet domain, this traffic it's considered dangerus and insecure. (the goverment try to explodes the browser for deanonymization) On darknet onion and i2p domains, squid will open the SSL tunnel and inspect for possible exploits, virus and attacks to the user.
If this connection it's to a HTTPS regular/banking domain, this SSL tunnel will be not open Bumped/inspected. Will be routed directly to the clearnet internet (ex: https://yourbank.com)

When the user is using HTTP, because is considered insecure itself this clear traffic is going to go through TOR to add anonymization but after a threatment from the local engines to add privacy on it.. The user can also decide in the future about which things he dont want to use TOr for HTTP.
To provide full internet security, we want IDS/IPS to inspect all kind of communications in our network: tor, i2p and direct.
But we also want to inspect all secure connections. To do so, we use squid proxy with ssl-bump feature to perform mitm.
All decrypted traffic goes to icap server, where it's being scanned by clam antivirus.

To accomplish our goal, we are going to make Suricata listen on two interfaces:
 -  On LAN Suricata is going to detect potentially bad traffic (incoming and outgoing), block attackers/compromised hosts, tor exit nodes, etc.
Suricata will inspect packets using default sets of rules: 
  Botnet Command and Control Server Rules (BotCC),
  ciarmy.com Top Attackers List,
  Known CompromisedHost List,
  Spamhaus.org DROP List,
  Dshield Top Attackers List,
  Tor exit Nodes List,
  Protocol events List.
 -  On localhost Suricata is supposed to scan icap port for bad content: browser/activex exploits, malware, attacks, etc.
Modified emerging signatures for browsers will be implemented for this purpose.

**Loopback issue:**

Suricata >=3.1 is unable to listen on loopback in afp mode. When run with -i lo option, it dies with this messages:

\<Error\> - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_INVALID_VALUE(130)] - Frame size bigger than block size

\<Error\> - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_AFP_CREATE(190)] - Couldn't init AF_PACKET socket, fatal error

Same configuration works fine with Suricata v3.0.0.

**Possible solutions:**

- Use pcap mode on lo and af-packet on eth0. May not be possible, because since 3.1 Suricata use af-packet mode by default
- Reduce the MTU size

## I2P configuration.

## Multiple Squids (darknet bumping and clearnet ssl NObump) configurations.

 








###HSTS 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security

Problem: when a use uses the google/bing search by a direct query keyword in the browsers
The browser enfoces hsts then the certificate from our redirected yacy fails.
Then we cant inspect the traffic for this big list of domains:
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json
We inspect for protecting the browser against exploitation of bugs and attacks.
Who can guaranteed this entities are not doing it?

We inspect the HSTS domains with Snort,Suricata BRO and CLamAV via ICAP CCAP and Squid bumping

The problem is that the redirection we made when the user tries gmail for instance in to local service mailpile fails with multiple browser because hsts.

Why we redirect gmail to mailpile or roundcube? obvious we offer s elfhosted solution better than corporate centralized.

Iptables are configured on /etc/rc.local script, and from here other scripts can be called to add/delete/modify
activerules.First of all let's go ensure to clean all rules in all tables, for that we do:

**
iptables -X
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t filter -F
**

Next we do basic rules to allow some traffic to the local services. 
Let's explain why we use a logical bridge interfacehere instead the physical interface.You can observe on this block of 
rules we filter matching also interface, that is **br1**
The use of logical bridge facilitates to use same know at priory 
name for further interfaces, in a way we can call itbr1 and save fixed rules based on that name, and later we can add/remove 
physical interfaces on this bridge, dependingparticual requirements of the enduser.On first stage when we are running 
configuration-script.sh we don't know yet if the enduser will be use some ports or not, what ports are connected to internet 
router and what ports are connected to the internal lan.More than that, eve we don't know if some of these ports are WIFI on 
some wlanN interfaces, and we have no way toknow it at this stage.Then as default initial configuration the br1 interface is 
builded with eth1 and wlan1 ( even those doesn't exist orare unconnected ) by the configuration script.Notice iptables rules 
applied to ANY interface part of a bridge will cause the rule is valid for the whole bridge,in other words, if we place a rule 
for eth1 , will affect to wlan1 too.Later, on wizard.sh script the user will be prompted to tell what physical interfaces ( he 
doesn't know about thelogical ones !! ) he is going to connect and where, as well if required for WIFI id and credentials.On 
this stage br1 may be modified , removing or adding interfaces.The second purpose to work on bridged model , at least on the 
internal lan, is that is required to create some bridgeto use the AP services, where the Librerouter box will act as WIFI 

Access Point for the internal lan.Now the next iptables rules are:
**
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.11 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.12 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.238 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.239 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.240 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.241 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.242 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.243 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.244 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.245 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.246 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.247 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.248 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.249 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.250 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.251 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.252 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.253 -j ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.254 -j ACCEPT
**

This block only ensures the internal traffic is accepted, really nothing happens if we remove it while we havenot any further 
rule dening that traffic.Is important to take in mind that iptables runs in the order we enter the rules and once one rule is 
matchedthe next rules are NOT checked.Iptables use -A ( append = put at the end of other existing rules ), -I ( insert, you can 
insert the rule at topor at some position ) and -D ( delete the rule )Next block:

**
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.1 --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 22
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p udp -d 10.0.0.1 --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.1 --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.1 --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 443
**

Even the syntax used here is a bit different, really does same, accept the traffic to some ports on theIP 10.0.0.1, redirecting 
to the same port, that is matching that traffic and ignoring next rules in orderin the tables.Now comes a block per each 
service:

**### to squid-i2p ###
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT     -d 10.191.0.1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 10.191.0.1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -d 10.191.0.1 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128
**

First line matches all outgoing traffic with destination IP 10.191.0.1 and destination port 80 and redirect itto the port 3128
Second line does same but with all originated traffic in the box ( or injected traffic as ip_forwarding=1 )Third line does same 
but for inverse traffic on the bridge 1 incoming traffic from port 80 and destination 10.191.0.1The result is all outgoing 
traffic on any interface to 10.191.0.1:80, al traffic passing through the Librerouter withdestination 10.191.0.1:80 and all 
traffic in bridge1 with destination 10.191.0.1 and source port 80 , all them goesredirected to port 3128

**#### ssh to tor socks proxy ###
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.0/8 --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9051
**
The traffic on the bridge to destination internal lan and destination port 22 ( SSH ) is redirected to theTor Socks5 service. 
Well Tor is not a Proxy like a HTTP Proxy, but is a SOCKS, so don't come confuse withthe comment "ssh to tor socks proxy"

This causes all traffic from the internal lan ( same host or different host ) and destination port 22 is redirectedto the Tor 
service.

### to squid-tor
** iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.1:3129
### to squid http 
###
** 
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp -m ndpi --http -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3130
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.1:3130
### to squid https ### 
** 
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3131
**
These does similar to anterior, but redirecting to SQUID ports 3129, 3130 and 3131  

**### iptables nat###
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
**
Here is new rule called MASQUERADE that is focused to NAT the traffic in a way a packet ( remember we have ip_forward=1 
)comming into br1 with origination ip Host1 would reach the outside world as from Host1. Then of course the other endwill not 
know where to respond to that packet. We need to do MASQUERADE as this packed that doesn't matched any earlyrule goes to the 
eth0 ( our internet connection as default ) and go to the external world as from our public IP connection( our internet 
connection ). When response packect comes back the router will do translate it again to the Librerouter IPon eth0

**### Blocking ICMP from LAN_TO_WAN and from WAN_TO_LAN/ROUTER ###
iptables -A FORWARD -p ICMP -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -s 10.0.0.0/8 ! -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP**  

The first line just drop forwarding ICMP ( ping ) traffic from one interface to other different interface or IP.The second line drops all ICMP traffic comming not from the internal lan and with destination internal lan, so internal lancan be only pinged from the internal lan.This allows pinging to wan , that is pinging to the external world, but cuts discovering from any host that is not in theinternal lan via ping.

**### Blocking IPsec (All Directions) 
###
**
iptables -A INPUT -m ndpi --ip_ipsec -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -m ndpi --ip_ipsec -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -m ndpi --ip_ipsec -j DROP
**
We block all IPSEC traffic in all directions, all this traffic is dropped  

**### Blocking DNS request from client to any servers other than librerouter ###
iptables -A INPUT -i br1 -m ndpi --dns ! -d 10.0.0.1 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -m ndpi --dns ! -d 10.0.0.1 -j DROP**

We don't allow any traffic for DNS services with destination different of 10.0.0.1, in a way all domains must be resolvedin the Librerouter box and NEVER directly by external DNS servers.Finally .... we just drop all other forwarded traffic that didn't matched the previous rules with :

**iptables -P FORWARD DROP**
